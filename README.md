Task:

The Muse has a public API at:
https://www.themuse.com/developers/api/v2

Please use this to do the following:
1. Download a data set of articles using the “Posts” endpoint.
2. Produce one plot, in the spirit of exploratory data analysis
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis), that helps us understand the
data set.
3. Write a very simple text classifier that predicts the article tags. This can be extremely
basic, but please include:
• A measurement of predictive performance
• A list of improvements you would make to try to improve performance

Please refer to readme.txt for detailed explanations of each file the analysis.
